# Medical-Prescription-Upload-System

My First Simple PHP web application 

A simple PHP + MySQL web application that allows users to upload medical prescriptions and pharmacies to prepare and send quotations. The system has two user roles: User and Pharmacy.

It allows **Users** to upload medical prescriptions and **Pharmacies** to prepare and send quotations.  Users can then accept or reject quotations, and pharmacies get notified.
